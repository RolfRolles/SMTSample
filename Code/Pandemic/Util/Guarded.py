"""This module implements "guarded" integers.  They are a fixed size, and are
always truncated to that size upon creation or modification.  As such, they are
similar to how integers normally behave in a language like C.  Implementing 
them this way allows us to represent things that are larger or smaller than
standard C types.  For example, we can represent a 3-bit integer, or a 9-bit
integer.
